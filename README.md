Should I buy a new car or keep the old one and just drive less to reduce my carbon footprint? If I save some emissions by changing my behaviour, how long will it take before I can allow myself to go off on holiday by plane? And if everyone acted like me, how much time is left to do business in a climate-neutral way, so that global warming is kept within limits?

Coalculator is a game about offsetting greenhouse gas emissions. It is based on statistical data and informs in a playful way. Players can set goals for themselves, share goals with others and simulate what they can do to offset their own carbon footprint.
